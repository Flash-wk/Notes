\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Imagine planning a delivery route around a graph, starting from a particular vertex.
\item What's the least cost by which you can visit every vertex without ever returning to one~?
\item Finding the optimal path (to reduce travelling time) is an \verb^NP-hard^ problem - 
read up on Computational Complexity Theory to understand this better.
\item For small graphs you could do this exhaustively, but for very large graphs you have
to use some heuristics.
\item One `greedy' approach is to simply go to your closest unvisited neighbour each time.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item It's often important to find the shortest path through a graph from one vertex to another.
\item One way of doing this is the greedy algorithm due to Dijkstra discovered $~1956$.
\item Picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest distance, \& calculate the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, updating the neighbour's distance if smaller.
\item Mark visited when done with neighbors.
